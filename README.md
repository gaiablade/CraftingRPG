# CraftingRPG #

As of May 2024, this project is considered COMPLETE. While some bugs still exist and a few features remain unfinished, I
consider the purpose of the game to be achieved. I might return to this project at a later date.

CraftingRPG is a technical demo created by Gaiablade. This project was created
as a place for me to experiment with game development patterns and create a fun
game.

While working on this project, I have a few goals in mind:

1. The game should be simple but solidly-built.
2. The game should be easily extensible; smart use of interfaces and generics can make adding new
   items/enemies/behaviors easy.
3. The code should be easy to navigate and come back to after not being updated for extended period of time.
